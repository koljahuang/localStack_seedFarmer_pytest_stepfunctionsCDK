# Installation

Seed-Farmer can be installed from PyPi.  It is suggested to create a virtual environment in Python to isolate / separate your libraries.

Create a new directory and create a new virtual env under that dir.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Then install seedfarmer:
```bash
pip install seed-farmer
