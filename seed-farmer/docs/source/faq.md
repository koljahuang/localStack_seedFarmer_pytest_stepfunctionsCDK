## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do SeedFarmer and AWS CodeSeeder work together?
`seedfarmer`is the CLI support for the opensource library [AWS CodeSeeder](https://aws-codeseeder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with [source code](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-codeseeder) here.  You can programatically use `AWS CodeSeeder` without `seedfarmer`, but `seedfarmer` cannot function without `AWS CodeSeeder`.
